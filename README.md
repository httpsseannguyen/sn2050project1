Greetings!!! I am an amateur coder, I am still learning math, and reliant on a few libraries! I hope that my code isn't too confusing.

Here are some expectations:

1. Multiple drafts of code/duplicates for my use
2. Inefficient algorithms
3. Code that I used from leetcode problems that I have solved.
4. A lot of tutorial content!!
